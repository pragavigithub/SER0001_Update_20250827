## Final Build Commands

1. **Clear everything (if needed):**
```bash
taskkill /f /im node.exe
rmdir /s "C:\Users\LENOVO\.gradle\caches"
cd react_native_app
rmdir /s node_modules
npm install
```

2. **Build the app:**
```bash
cd react_native_app
npx react-native run-android
```

## What to Expect
- ✅ No more "Unsupported class file major version 66" errors
- ✅ No more "Plugin not found" errors  
- ✅ React Native autolinking handles all dependencies
- ✅ Clean build with Java 22 and Gradle 8.8
- ✅ Android app installs and runs successfully

## If You Still Get sqlite-storage Warning
The warning about `react-native-sqlite-storage` configuration is harmless:
```
warn Package react-native-sqlite-storage contains invalid configuration: "dependency.platforms.ios.project" is not allowed.
```
This is a known issue with the package but doesn't affect Android builds.

## Troubleshooting
If build still fails:
1. Check Java version: `java -version` (should show Java 22)
2. Clear Metro cache: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
3. Clean Android: `cd android && .\gradlew clean`
4. Use verbose output: `npx react-native run-android --verbose`
