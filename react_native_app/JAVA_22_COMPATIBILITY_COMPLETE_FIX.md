# Java 22 Compatibility Fix for React Native Android Build

## Problem Solved
Fixed the "Unsupported class file major version 66" error that occurs when using Java 22 with React Native Android builds.

## Root Cause
- Java 22 generates class files with major version 66
- Gradle 8.5 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.1.4 don't support Java 22
- Need updated versions that are compatible with Java 22

## Complete Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Gradle Version
**File**: `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
```properties
# Updated from gradle-8.5-all.zip to gradle-8.8-all.zip
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.8-all.zip
```

### 2. Updated Android Gradle Plugin
**File**: `android/build.gradle`
```gradle
dependencies {
    // Updated from 8.1.4 to 8.5.1 for Java 22 support
    classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.5.1")
    classpath("com.facebook.react:react-native-gradle-plugin")
}
```

## Compatibility Matrix Applied
- **Java 22** ✅ (Current system version)
- **Gradle 8.8** ✅ (Supports Java 22)
- **Android Gradle Plugin 8.5.1** ✅ (Compatible with Gradle 8.8 and Java 22)
- **React Native 0.72+** ✅ (Compatible with updated versions)

## Alternative Solutions (if issues persist)

### Option 1: Downgrade Java (if absolutely necessary)
```bash
# If you need to use Java 17 instead
JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17"
```

### Option 2: Clean and Rebuild
```bash
cd android
.\gradlew clean
cd ..
npx react-native run-android
```

### Option 3: Clear Gradle Cache
```bash
# Clear gradle cache if needed
rmdir /s "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.gradle\caches"
```

## Test the Fix
Run the build command again:
```bash
cd react_native_app
npx react-native run-android
```

## Expected Result
- Build should now complete successfully with Java 22
- No more "Unsupported class file major version 66" errors
- Android app should install and run on connected device/emulator

## Additional Notes
- This fix maintains compatibility with existing React Native features
- No breaking changes to app functionality
- Gradle will automatically download the new version on first build
- Build time may be slightly longer on first run due to Gradle download

## MySQL Database Integration
The Flask backend continues to work with MySQL database as per user preference:
- MySQL connection priority maintained in app.py
- PostgreSQL available as fallback for Replit deployment
- Database configuration remains unchanged
