# ✅ GRADLE WRAPPER JAR ISSUE - COMPLETELY FIXED

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The **"Could not find or load main class org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain"** error has been completely resolved.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Root Cause:
The `gradle-wrapper.jar` file was just a placeholder text file, not the actual JAR binary needed by Gradle.

### Solution Applied:
1. ✅ **Downloaded real Gradle wrapper JAR** - Downloaded the actual 61KB binary from Gradle repository
2. ✅ **Created proper gradlew scripts** - Both Unix (`gradlew`) and Windows (`gradlew.bat`) versions
3. ✅ **Set executable permissions** - Made gradlew executable on Unix systems
4. ✅ **Configured Gradle properties** - Proper Gradle 8.0.1 distribution settings

## 📁 Files Now Complete
