# 🔧 Java 22 Compatibility Fix - Complete Solution

## 🎯 Problem: Java Version Mismatch

**Error**: "Unsupported class file major version 66"  
**Cause**: You're using Java 22, but Android build tools need Java 17 compatibility.

## ✅ Applied Fixes

### 1. Java Compatibility Settings Added:
- Set `sourceCompatibility` and `targetCompatibility` to Java 17 in app/build.gradle
- Added encoding and JVM args in gradle.properties
- Updated Gradle to 8.5 for Java 22 support

### 2. Gradle Cache Clear Script:
- Created `gradle-clean.bat` to clear problematic cache files
- Forces Gradle to rebuild with new settings

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Clear Gradle Cache
```bash
cd react_native_app/android
gradle-clean.bat
```

### Step 2: Alternative Manual Cache Clear
```bash
cd react_native_app/android
gradlew --stop
gradlew clean
```

### Step 3: Build with Clean Cache
```bash
cd react_native_app
npx react-native run-android
```

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions

### Option A: Install Java 17 (Recommended)
1. Download Java 17 from: https://jdk.java.net/17/
2. Install and set JAVA_HOME:
   ```
   JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.x
   ```
3. Update PATH to include Java 17 bin directory

### Option B: Use Project-Specific Java
Edit `android/gradle.properties` and set:
```
org.gradle.java.home=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.x
```

### Option C: Force Java 17 for Android Build
Already applied in your project:
- Java 17 compatibility in app/build.gradle
- Gradle 8.5 for Java 22 host support
- Optimized JVM settings

## 🔍 Check Your Setup

```bash
# Check system Java version
java -version

# Check Gradle Java version (should work with our fixes)
cd react_native_app/android
gradlew -version
```

## ✅ Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
1. Gradle cache clears successfully
2. Build uses Java 17 compatibility mode
3. Android APK builds and installs
4. WMS Mobile App launches on device
