# Complete NDK Error Solution

## The Problem
React Native is trying to build `react-native-reanimated` even though it's not in package.json because of auto-linking.

## Complete Solution

### Step 1: Clean Everything
```bash
cd react_native_app
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Step 2: Clean Android Build
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Clear React Native Cache
```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

### Step 4: Run with Specific NDK Version
Make sure you have NDK 21.4.7075529 installed:
1. Open Android Studio
2. SDK Manager > SDK Tools
3. Install NDK (Side by side) version 21.4.7075529

### Step 5: Set Environment Variable (Windows)
```cmd
set ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=C:\Users\LENOVO\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\21.4.7075529
```

### Step 6: Try Alternative Build Method
If still failing, try:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## What We Fixed:
✅ Disabled react-native-reanimated in react-native.config.js
✅ Changed NDK version to stable 21.4.7075529
✅ Added packaging options to prevent conflicts
✅ Fixed sqlite-storage configuration

## If Still Getting Errors:
The issue might be that some dependency is pulling in reanimated. Check:
```bash
npm ls react-native-reanimated
```

If it shows up, remove the dependency that's including it or manually exclude it.
