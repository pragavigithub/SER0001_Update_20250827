# React Native Build Success - Final Configuration

## ✅ Issue Completely Resolved!

The React Native Android build is now working with Java 22. Here's what was fixed:

### Final Configuration Applied

#### 1. settings.gradle (Simplified)
```gradle
rootProject.name = 'WMSMobileApp'
apply from: file("../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/native_modules.gradle"); applyNativeModulesSettingsGradle(settings)
include ':app'
includeBuild('../node_modules/@react-native/gradle-plugin')
```

#### 2. Gradle Compatibility
- ✅ **Gradle 8.8** (supports Java 22)
- ✅ **Android Gradle Plugin 8.5.1** (compatible with Java 22)
- ✅ **React Native 0.72.6** (native modules autolinking)

#### 3. Native Modules Integration
- Using React Native Community CLI native modules approach
- Automatic dependency linking (no manual configuration needed)
- Compatible with React Native 0.72.6

### Build Command
```bash
cd react_native_app
npx react-native run-android
```

### Expected Warnings (These are Normal)
```
warn Package react-native-sqlite-storage contains invalid configuration: "dependency.platforms.ios.project" is not allowed.
```
This warning is harmless and doesn't affect Android builds.

### Deprecation Warnings (These are Normal)
```
Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 9.0.
```
These are just warnings about future Gradle versions and don't prevent the build from succeeding.

## Success Indicators
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ APK installs on Android device/emulator
- ✅ App launches successfully
- ✅ Java 22 compatibility maintained

## Troubleshooting (If Needed)
1. Clear cache: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
2. Clean build: `cd android && .\gradlew clean`
3. Check device: `adb devices`
4. Verbose output: `npx react-native run-android --verbose`

Your React Native mobile app should now build and run successfully with Java 22!
