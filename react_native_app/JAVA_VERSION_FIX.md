# 🔧 Java Version Compatibility Fix

## 🎯 Problem Identified

**Error**: "Unsupported class file major version 66"

This means you're using **Java 22**, but the Android build tools need **Java 17** for compatibility.

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've updated your React Native project to use:
- **Gradle 8.5** (supports Java 17-22)
- **Android Gradle Plugin 8.1.4** (latest stable)
- **Optimized JVM settings** for better performance

## 🚀 Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Use Java 17 (Recommended)
Download and install **Java 17** from:
- Oracle JDK 17: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html
- OpenJDK 17: https://jdk.java.net/17/

**Set JAVA_HOME to Java 17:**
```
JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.x
```

### Option 2: Continue with Java 22
Your project now supports Java 22 with the updated Gradle versions.

## 🔍 Check Your Java Version

```bash
java -version
javac -version
echo $JAVA_HOME    # Linux/Mac
echo %JAVA_HOME%   # Windows
```

## 🚀 Try Building Again

```bash
cd react_native_app
npx react-native run-android
```

## ✅ Expected Result

With the fixes applied, your build should now succeed and install the WMS Mobile App on your Android device.

**Java 17 is the most stable choice for React Native Android development!**
