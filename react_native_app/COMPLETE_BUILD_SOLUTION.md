# Complete Android Build Solution

## Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ NDK installation error (react-native-reanimated removed)
2. ✅ Camera variant conflict (react-native-camera disabled)  
3. ✅ SQLite storage configuration warning fixed
4. ✅ Gradle dependency conflicts resolved

## Steps to Build Successfully:

### 1. Clean Everything
```bash
cd react_native_app
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

### 2. Clean Android Build
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```

### 3. Clear Metro Cache
```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

### 4. Build Android App
```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

## What We Changed:
- **Removed react-native-camera**: Caused variant conflicts with Gradle 7.4.2
- **Kept react-native-vision-camera**: Modern alternative for barcode scanning
- **Fixed SQLite config**: Disabled iOS platform to stop configuration warnings
- **Updated NDK version**: Changed to stable 21.4.7075529
- **Disabled auto-linking**: For problematic modules in react-native.config.js

## Alternative Build Method:
If the above still fails, try building directly with Gradle:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## USB Debugging Setup:
1. Enable Developer Options on your phone
2. Enable USB Debugging
3. Connect via USB cable
4. Allow USB debugging when prompted
5. Run `adb devices` to verify connection

Your phone should now show up and the app should install successfully!
