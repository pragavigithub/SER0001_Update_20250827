# Quick Android Build Fix

## Steps to Fix NDK Error

1. **Install NDK in Android Studio** (Recommended):
   - Open Android Studio
   - Go to SDK Manager (Tools > SDK Manager)
   - Click "SDK Tools" tab
   - Check "NDK (Side by side)" version 21.4.7075529
   - Click Apply to install

2. **Alternative: Use Environment Variable**:
   Add to your system environment variables:
   ```
   ANDROID_NDK_ROOT=C:\Users\LENOVO\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\21.4.7075529
   ```

3. **Clean and Rebuild**:
   ```bash
   cd react_native_app
   npx react-native clean
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

## Changes Made:
- ✅ Removed react-native-reanimated (causes NDK issues)
- ✅ Changed NDK version to stable 21.4.7075529
- ✅ Added react-native.config.js for proper sqlite-storage configuration
- ✅ Added packaging options to avoid duplicate library conflicts
- ✅ Fixed gradle configuration warnings

## If Still Having Issues:
Run this command to check your NDK installation:
```bash
echo $ANDROID_NDK_ROOT
ls -la "$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/ndk/"
```

The app will work without reanimated - core React Native Animated API provides sufficient animation capabilities.
