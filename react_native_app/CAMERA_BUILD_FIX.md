# Camera Build Fix Solution

## Problem
- react-native-camera has conflicting variants (generalDebug vs mlkitDebug)
- This causes Gradle build failures

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed react-native-camera** from dependencies (causes variant conflicts)
2. **Kept react-native-vision-camera** (modern, stable alternative)
3. **Disabled camera autolinking** in react-native.config.js

## Changes Made:
✅ Removed duplicate react-native-camera dependency  
✅ Fixed react-native-sqlite-storage iOS configuration warning  
✅ Disabled problematic react-native-camera autolinking  
✅ Kept react-native-vision-camera for barcode scanning functionality  

## Next Steps:
1. Clean build cache:
   ```bash
   cd react_native_app
   npx react-native clean
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build again:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

## Vision Camera vs React Native Camera:
- **react-native-vision-camera**: Modern, actively maintained, better performance
- **react-native-camera**: Deprecated, has variant conflicts with newer Gradle versions

The app will use Vision Camera for barcode scanning which is more reliable and faster.
