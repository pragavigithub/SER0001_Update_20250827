WARNING:We recommend using a newer Android Gradle plugin to use compileSdk = 35                                                                                                     

This Android Gradle plugin (7.4.2) was tested up to compileSdk = 33

This warning can be suppressed by adding
    android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=35
to this project's gradle.properties

The build will continue, but you are strongly encouraged to update your project to
use a newer Android Gradle Plugin that has been tested with compileSdk = 35

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 8.0.

You can use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings and determine if they come from your own scripts or plugins.

       1.  Dependency 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat-resources:1.7.0' requires libraries and applications that
           depend on it to compile against version 34 or later of the
           Android APIs.

           :app is currently compiled against android-33.

           Also, the maximum recommended compile SDK version for Android Gradle
           plugin 7.4.2 is 33.

           Recommended action: Update this project's version of the Android Gradle
           plugin to one that supports 34, then update this project to use
           compileSdkVerion of at least 34.

           Note that updating a library or application's compileSdkVersion (which
           allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
           targetSdkVersion (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
           minSdkVersion (which determines which devices the app can be installed
           on).
